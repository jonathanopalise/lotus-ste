# Lotus STE

This project is at a very early stage and currently doesn't do anything of interest to end users.

Directory layout is as follows:

* `bin` - contains binary patches generated by means of compiling the code in `src`.
* `doc` - contains documentation pertaining to the reverse engineering efforts of the ST side
* `src` - contains the core source code to generate the code for use on the ST side
* `util` - contains utilities for use in reverse engineering efforts

Run `build.sh` to generate the binary patch for use on the ST side.
